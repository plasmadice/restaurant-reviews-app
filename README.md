# Project Overview
This project demonstrates several skills. Making a website fully responsive, accessible, and available offline. This project was designed by Udacity for their Front End Nanodegree and Mobile Web Specialist courses

## How it Works
To start this project you will need to run a web server. Here are a few options.

1. From inside the new directory, launch a local client server using Python from your terminal and launch the server based on your version of python: 
1.a Python 2: python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000 
1.b Python 3: python3 -m http.server 8000
2. [VSCode's Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) - My Favorite - Requires additional steps - *Note* - I use VSCode - Once complete you can launch using liveserver as usual
2.a  **Easiest Method** - in `js/dbhelper.js` on line 11 change `port` to 5500
2.b Hard Mode - In VSCode settings change `liveServer.settings.port` to 8000
